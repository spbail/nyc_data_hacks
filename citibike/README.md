# Citibike data analysis

* NYC Open Data Week 2021 hack, Sam Bail (https://github.com/spbail, samanthapbail@gmail.com)
* Data from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
* This hack is just an initial exploration of the data due to time constraints

This notebook (check out the rendered HTML file) has two parts:

* Part 1: Data loading and transforming
* Part 2: The actual analysis 

Scroll down to Part 2 if you don't care much about the code.
